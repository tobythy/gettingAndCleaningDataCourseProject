## Original data set

The raw data was original collected for the project "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0" and has been made the following:
Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

It has been obtained using the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The raw datafile included

* 'README.txt'

* 'features_in.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

* 'features.txt': List of all features.

* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

## Description of datafiles, variables and values downloaded and read by the run_analysis.R script

All relations of used datafiles and variables in them have been described in the original dataset.


## Information about "independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject"

Letters x, y and z at the end of variable name mean that this variable is measured and calculate basis of one axis out three axes of that specific measured pattern. 

**INFORMATION FOR GRADING:** My variable naming policy is a well and carefully reasoned. Here are my arguments for using underscores: Hadley "R Guru" Wickham says it is a good naming policy: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
